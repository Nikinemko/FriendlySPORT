EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- Micah Parsons was not surprised by the Dallas Cowboys' 40-0 throttling of the New York Giants on Sunday. "No doubt in my mind," Parsons said. "I saw it before anybody. I said, 'I can't wait to get to New York.' I already knew we was coming. Just because when preparation meets execution, I don't think there's no one that can beat us." Sunday marked: _ The largest shutout win in franchise history. Before Sunday, that distinction belonged to a 38-0 win against the Baltimore Colts in 1978. _ The second-largest margin of victory against the Giants in 122 matchups. In 1966, the Cowboys opened the season with a 56-7 win over New York. And in 1995, the Cowboys opened the year with a 35-0 win against the Giants. \* The Cowboys became the fifth team to open their season with a shutout of 40-plus points on the road, according to ESPN Stats &amp; Information.
